  At this stage personalvibe project is an effective developer tool to use vibecoding for working with codebases

  This next milestone will add automated testing capabilities.

  After generating a spring, a developer needs to do the following steps manually:

  1. Execute the code patch
  2. Ensure the code patch ran successfully
  3. Run the test suite
  4. If there is a problem, generate a bugfix patch with logs

  This next milestone will look to handle the above four steps automatically, so that a code sprint
  is automatically tested

  It is possible for a codepatch and error correction to not work several times in a row,
  if that is the case, we would want a maximum of five retry attempts, otherwise we will fail the sprint update

  An important thing to note about our current process:
  When we apply a codepatch, we are applying it to our native code environment
  This is not a good idea, as it can cause corruption of our codebase on a partially effective patch

  What would be more ideal is to sandbox the execution of the code patch to ensure that it applied correctly

  To remove the Docker hurdle entirely, we’ll adopt a Wasmtime-based WebAssembly sandbox,
  Docker still demands a privileged daemon, heavy OCI images, and security exemptions,
  while Wasmtime lets us execute Python-WASI tests in a hermetic userspace process that works on macOS,
  Windows, and Linux with no kernel features or root access.
  The full runtime shrinks to ≈ 3 MB by using the wasmtime-min build,
  which we’ll vendor directly inside the PersonalVibe wheel for each OS/CPU pair;
  the installer selects or extracts the right binary automatically,
  so every developer enjoys one-command isolation without extra packages.

  So the order would be something like:

  1. Generate code patch
  2. Load sandbox environment
  3. Execute code patch
  4. If code did not run correctly, get error logs and return to step 1 (adding logs)
  5. If code did run correctly, run test suite
  6. If test suite fails, get error logs and return to step 1 (adding logs)

  At this stage the user can handle actually running the code patch, the purpose is to ensure its tested to succeed

  This also means that users need to specify a 'test suite' file, and this should have it's own
  parameter in the config file to point to the test file (i.e. `tests/personalvibe.sh`)
