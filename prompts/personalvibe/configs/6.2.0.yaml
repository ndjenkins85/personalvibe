# pv run --config prompts/personalvibe/configs/6.2.0.yaml

# Chunk 1 lays the foundation others depend on; without the shim nothing compiles.
# Chunk 2 propagates the new configuration so later migrations can compile.
# Chunk 3 switches the core execution pathâ€”riskier, but isolated by earlier scaffolding.
# Chunk 4 is optional functionality that proves pluggability without blocking migration.
# Chunk 5 polishes and documents, safest to do after behaviour stabilises.
