Personalvibe already has a clean separation between
• configuration (YAML in prompts/personalvibe/configs)
• prompt rendering + I/O (vibe_utils) and
• orchestration / CLI entry-point (run_pipeline, noxfile, tests/personalvibe.sh).

That tri-layer is exactly what we need for milestone-driven development: run_pipeline translates a tiny YAML “order” into a fully rendered prompt, vibe_utils knows how to pull contextual code, stamp it with a run-id, and ship it to the LLM, and the nox vibed session turns a semver into an atomic branch + quality-gate.  Nothing blocks us from expressing future milestones/sprints in the same way, so the current approach is considered “sufficient”.  The immediate functional gap, however, is reliable per-semver logging (logs/{semver}_base.log) and an automated assertion that the file is created and appended to by downstream tools such as pytest.

Therefore the next MAJOR milestone is “Logging & Quality-gate foundation (v1)”.  Once finished the project will be able to:
• spin up a vibed/{semver} branch,
• guarantee that EVERY process involved in that sprint writes to logs/{semver}_base.log,
• ship a one-liner nox command (nox -s validate -- 1.1.0) that re-runs lint, tests and pushes their stdout/stderr into that same file, and
• keep the contract testable by a self-contained pytest suite driven through tests/personalvibe.sh.

Estimated size of milestone output
– new / patched source files ≈ 22 k chars
– new tests + shell script ≈ 12 k
– docs & templates ≈ 4 k
≈ 38 k characters total → well over the single-prompt limit, so the work must be chunked.

Chunking plan (≤ 5 chunks, each < 20 k chars)

1. Logging Harness & Tests (≈ 10 k)
   • Extend personalvibe.logger.configure_logging so that when run_id ends with “_base” it opens the file in “append” mode and writes “BEGIN-STAMP <timestamp>”.
   • Wire run_pipeline to derive run_id=f"{semver}_base" from the YAML version.
   • Add pytest test_logfile_created() that invokes logger.configure_logging(…, run_id="0.0.1_base") in a tmp path and asserts file existence + first line “RUN_ID=…”.
   • Ensure tests/personalvibe.sh executes pytest, and capture its output with tee -a logs/{semver}_base.log.

2. nox vibed enhancements (≈ 8 k)
   • Modify _log_to context manager so that it opens logs/{semver}_base.log in append mode, not overwrite.
   • Pass --verbosity=verbose to run_pipeline so internal INFO lines flow into the same tee.
   • Unit test via nox -s vibed -- 0.0.2 dummy_patch.py inside pytest (uses subprocess) and assert that the base log contains the three step banners.

3. Prompt persistence hardening (≈ 8 k)
   • Refactor vibe_utils.save_prompt to return Path and to always append “### END PROMPT” for easier grepping.
   • Add duplicate-hash test.
   • Document the hashing strategy in README.

4. Developer On-boarding & SPA place-holders (≈ 6 k)
   • Write docs/setup_python.md and docs/setup_spa.md (instructions for non-React users to prepare for future sprints).
   • Add a “bootstrap” make target.

5. Flask skeleton with integrated logger (≈ 6 k)
   • Very thin Flask “/healthz” endpoint; on startup it calls configure_logging(run_id="devserver_base").
   • Pytest file with client.get("/healthz") and log assertion.

Priority order (start-first rationale)
1 Logging Harness & Tests – foundational: later chunks depend on assured log file behaviour.
2 nox vibed enhancements – leverages the harness so manual + CI runs are already captured.
3 Prompt persistence – orthogonal but still core infra; safe second-layer.
4 Developer on-boarding – no runtime deps; can happen in parallel once logging is solid.
5 Flask skeleton – optional to milestone success; safest to tackle last.

This phased breakdown keeps every chunk under ~10 k–12 k characters, well below the 20 k ceiling, while delivering testable value after each sprint.
