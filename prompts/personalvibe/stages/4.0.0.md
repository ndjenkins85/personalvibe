Personal vibe has gradually grown out of its original “two-projects-in-one-folder” setup.
At this point the Python package already compiles, ships a console-script, is fully covered by lint/tests, and even has wheel-smoke-tests. What is **missing** is a clean contractual boundary: the library must be consumable from *other* repositories without dragging along the abandoned Storymaker surface, obsolete dev‐tools or documentation that only makes sense in a mono-repo.
Therefore the next milestone is not about new runtime features, but about **turning Personal vibe into a truly independent, reusable project** while guaranteeing that the quality-gate still passes.

Below is a concrete plan that honours the 20 000-character LLM output cap, keeps the amount of human/manual work reasonable, and allows us to test after every step.  The work is split into logical, loosely-coupled chunks so that each one can be delivered (and reviewed) in a single LLM call and still leave the repository in a buildable state.

------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Current state – short assessment
------------------------------------------------------------------
• The package builds, installs, and exposes a CLI; unit- and smoke-tests run via `noxfile.py` and `tests/personalvibe.sh`.
• `pyproject.toml` lists many dependencies that belong to Storymaker (Flask, Flask-Cors, React/SPA hints, etc.).
• The noxfile still contains helper sessions that operate on *two* code bases (`personalvibe`, `storymaker`).
• README, docs and dev-tooling assume a mono-repo checkout and mention Storymaker specifics.
• All tests pass, but they do not verify that the wheel can be imported from a *foreign* project that only installs the public dependencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Next major milestone
------------------------------------------------------------------
Milestone 2.1.0 — “Independence Day”
Goal: Refactor repository so that *Personal vibe* stands on its own, with a minimal dependency footprint and self-contained documentation/testing pipeline.

Success criteria
• `poetry build && pip install dist/*.whl && python -c "import personalvibe"` works in a fresh venv.
• The consolidated test runner (`tests/personalvibe.sh`) passes locally and on CI.
• README and docs no longer mention Storymaker or mono-repo specifics.
• Nox sessions only reference Personal vibe sources.
• `pyproject.toml` “prod” section lists only what the installed wheel really needs; extra tooling lives in proper `[tool.poetry.group.*]` groups.

------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Size estimate for the milestone
------------------------------------------------------------------
• Trimmed pyproject (±250 lines ≈ 4 000 chars)
• New / rewritten README (±200 lines ≈ 6 000 chars)
• Re-worked `noxfile.py` (±150 lines ≈ 3 000 chars)
• Unified bash test runner (±80 lines ≈ 1 500 chars)
• Small touch-ups in docs, CI yml, imports (±100 lines total ≈ 2 000 chars)

≈ **17 000 characters** → fits comfortably below the 20 k hard limit.

------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Chunking strategy (≤5 chunks, all individually testable)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Chunk A  “Dependency diet”
  • Remove Storymaker-only libs from `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`.
  • Move lint/format/test/docs tools into `[tool.poetry.group.*]`.
  • Add `poetry export --only main` smoke-test to ensure runtime deps are complete.

Chunk B  “Noxfile cleanse”
  • Delete sessions that reference Storymaker paths.
  • Keep `lint`, `tests`, `smoke_dist`; update `locations` tuple to `"src/personalvibe", "tests", "noxfile.py"`.
  • Make sure local `pytest -m not advanced` still works.

Chunk C  “Single source of truth for tests”
  • Re-write `tests/personalvibe.sh` so it orchestrates:
    1) `poetry install --sync --no-root`
    2) `poetry run nox -rs lint tests smoke_dist`
  • Ensure the script returns non-zero on failure (for CI).

Chunk D  “Docs & README refresh”
  • Replace Storymaker mentions, add import-as-library example, and SPA bootstrap appendix.
  • Update INSTALL.md and USING_IN_OTHER_PROJECTS.md accordingly.

Chunk E  “Release rehearsal”
  • Bump version to `2.1.0`, run wheel smoke-test inside GitHub Actions matrix, and document the manual release checklist.

Character budget per chunk: A≈3 k, B≈3 k, C≈2 k, D≈7 k, E≈2 k — all well below the 20 k limit.

------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Recommended execution order
------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Chunk A – trimming dependencies must happen first; downstream chunks rely on the lean lock-file.
2) Chunk B – once deps are correct, tidy up the automation entry-points.
3) Chunk C – consolidate the quality-gate so that subsequent edits keep proving themselves.
4) Chunk D – refresh documentation after technical details stabilise.
5) Chunk E – final polish & release simulation closes the milestone.

------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Why this order & how it meets the brief
------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting with the **dependency diet** gives us the smallest, most mechanical change that nevertheless influences *every* other slice of the repo. By proving the package can import without Flask et al. we de-risk later chunks.
Cleaning the noxfile next removes obsolete surface area and speeds up local CI runs, which is valuable when repeatedly invoking the unified bash test harness.

Only after the tooling is reliable do we touch user-facing docs: this avoids documenting something that may still shift after earlier refactors. Finally, a dry-run release confirms “independence” in the only place that matters — an empty virtualenv that has *never* heard of Storymaker.

With these five concise, test-driven chunks we can confidently deliver the milestone inside the 20 000-character LLM output ceiling while maintaining a pleasant human review cadence.
