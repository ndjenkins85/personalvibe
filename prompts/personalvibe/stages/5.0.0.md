Below is the high-level plan for the next major iteration of Personalvibe.
It starts from the current reality: functional tests are green, the lint gate is red, and day-to-day pain points centre on “too much typing”, mis-versioned sprint files and noisy tooling.  Therefore the milestone focuses on developer-experience wins first, then folds in the new workflow helpers and doc tidy-up.  Everything is sliced so that no single sprint prompt must exceed 20 000 characters of generated text, and the whole milestone is achievable in ≤ 5 such chunks.

Applying this to the brief, we will (1) stabilise the codebase by silencing flake8 noise and pruning dead branches, (2) bake auto-project-detection straight into the CLI and template helpers, (3) generate the new “milestone” / “prepare-sprint” commands while fixing the bug-patch naming error, (4) harden IO (yaml-sanitiser, `--open` flag, Unicode safety) and (5) close with documentation restructure so the README truly routes users to every artefact.  The work is ordered so each subsequent chunk builds on a clean, test-passing baseline.

Approximate size of the whole milestone
• Code & tests to touch or add: ~55 000 chars
• Narrative docs & templates: ~10 000 chars
→ Total ≈ 65 000 chars → comfortably fits into five ≤ 20 000-char LLM bursts.

Chunk 1
Title: Lint-Zero & Code-Cull
Scope:
• Fix all F*, E*, S* and ANN* errors shown in current flake8 run.
• Remove duplicate / superseded helper blocks inside `noxfile.py` and `vibe_utils.py`.
• Delete dead imports, add missing type hints for public functions, convert stray triple-quoted one-liners to single-line docstrings.
• Update `.flake8` `application-import-names` to `personalvibe`.
• CI: change quality-gate so “lint” breaks only on > 0 errors, not warnings.
Size: 15 k chars
Rationale: Until lint passes, every following PR fails the automated gate, blocking real progress.

Chunk 2
Title: Implicit Project Detection
Scope:
• Implement `vibe_utils.detect_project_name(cwd: Path) -> str` using repo-root walk (`prompts/<name>` sentinel).
• Modify `cli.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `parse_stage.py` and test helpers so `--project_name` becomes optional everywhere it is currently mandatory.
• Fallback: if detection fails, keep existing arg with helpful error.
• Unit tests covering cwd deep inside repo & installed-package scenarios.
Size: 12 k chars
Rationale: This erases the most frequent manual input and is prerequisite for the new helper commands that must know the project automatically.

Chunk 3
Title: New-Milestone & Prepare-Sprint Commands + Patch-Bug Fix
Scope:
• Add sub-commands `pv new-milestone` and `pv prepare-sprint` that:
  – locate `prompts/{project}/stages`,
  – copy template yaml from `personalvibe/data`,
  – compute next version (`n+1.0.0` or `1.0.0` if none),
  – open the file via `$EDITOR` or `open`/`xdg-open`.
• Fix “bug-fix patch increments sprint number” bug: adjust regex in `parse_stage.determine_next_version()` so for input `4.3.0` it emits `4.3.1`, not `4.4.0`.
• Regression tests for both behaviours.
Size: 18 k chars
Rationale: Provides the productivity features requested in the PRD and eliminates the confusing patch mis-naming.

Chunk 4
Title: IO & UX Hardening
Scope:
• Add YAML sanitiser: strip / replace control chars `\x00‥\x1F`, raise clear error on remaining invalid runes.
• Enhance `tests/personalvibe.sh` with `--open` flag → after completion call `open LOG_FILE` (mac) / `xdg-open` (linux).
• Thread-safe write in `save_prompt` to avoid race on parallel runs.
• Extra unit tests for unreadable char failure and `--open` path.
Size: 10 k chars
Rationale: Removes the last “data corruption” class bug and rounds out the CLI ergonomics.

Chunk 5
Title: Documentation Directory & Release Prep
Scope:
• Re-organise docs so README is a hub: add miniature TOC that links to INSTALL, ONBOARDING, USING_IN_OTHER_PROJECTS and generated API reference.
• Create `docs/roadmap/3.0.0_milestone.md` summarising chunks above.
• Update Sphinx `conf.py` to autodoc new modules, ensure `make html` passes.
• Bump version to `3.0.0-alpha0`, update CHANGELOG.
Size: 10 k chars
Rationale: Locks the milestone narrative in place and prepares ground for public release.

Recommended execution order
1. Chunk 1 – lint baseline
2. Chunk 2 – project detection scaffolding
3. Chunk 3 – new commands + bug-fix
4. Chunk 4 – IO hardening
5. Chunk 5 – docs & release polish
### END PROMPT
