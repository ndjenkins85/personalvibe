## Strategic Analysis & Sprint Planning for Automated Testing Milestone

The personalvibe project has reached a critical juncture where manual testing workflows are becoming a bottleneck to development velocity. The current vibecoding process requires developers to manually execute code patches, run test suites, and handle error correctionâ€”creating friction that automated testing capabilities can eliminate. The proposed Wasmtime-based WebAssembly sandbox represents a sophisticated solution that avoids Docker's complexity while providing hermetic isolation across all major platforms.

My recommendation focuses on delivering this automation through 5 carefully orchestrated sprints that balance technical complexity with testable increments. Each sprint builds essential scaffolding while maintaining the project's commitment to developer experience and cross-platform compatibility. The approach prioritizes core sandbox infrastructure first, then layers on the automated testing workflows, ensuring each component can be validated independently before integration.

**Total Estimated Scope:** ~65,000 characters across 5 sprints
**Recommended Sprint Size:** 4-5 sprints to stay within the milestone limit

## Sprint Breakdown (Ranked by Implementation Priority)

**Chunk 1: Wasmtime Integration & Binary Management** (~15,000 chars)
- Core Wasmtime binary detection, extraction, and platform-specific loading
- Minimal sandbox initialization and Python-WASI environment setup
- Binary vendoring system for OS/CPU-specific wasmtime-min builds
- Essential error handling for missing or incompatible binaries
- Basic smoke tests to verify Wasmtime can execute simple Python code

Note, the wasm mini binary is available at: `src/personalvibe/_bin/wasmtime-darwin-aarch64-min`

**Chunk 2: Sandbox Environment Core** (~14,000 chars)
- Hermetic file system isolation and temporary workspace management
- Python code injection and execution infrastructure within sandbox
- Stdout/stderr capture mechanisms and result parsing
- Basic exit code handling and timeout protection
- Integration tests for code patch execution scenarios

**Chunk 3: Test Suite Integration** (~12,000 chars)
- Test suite discovery and execution within sandbox environment
- Test result parsing and status determination (pass/fail/error)
- Log aggregation from both code execution and test runs
- Configuration system for specifying test suite files
- Validation framework for test execution success criteria

**Chunk 4: Automated Retry Logic** (~13,000 chars)
- 5-attempt retry mechanism with error log collection
- Intelligent failure classification (execution vs. test suite failures)
- Error context preservation and progressive retry with enhanced logging
- Sprint failure detection and graceful degradation
- Integration with existing personalvibe error handling patterns

**Chunk 5: CLI Integration & Workflow Automation** (~11,000 chars)
- Enhancement of existing `pv sprint` command to support automated testing
- Configuration file updates for test suite specification
- User-facing controls for enabling/disabling automation
- Documentation and usage examples
- End-to-end integration tests with real sprint workflows

This chunking strategy ensures that foundational infrastructure (Wasmtime integration) is established first, providing the essential scaffolding that all subsequent chunks depend upon. The progression from core sandbox functionality to test integration to retry logic creates natural validation points where each sprint's deliverables can be independently tested and verified before proceeding to the next layer of complexity.
