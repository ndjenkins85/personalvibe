Looking at this comprehensive personalvibe project and the requested milestone analysis, I need to evaluate the current state and propose the next major milestone focused on developer experience improvements, particularly adding a bugfix mode and addressing existing bugs.

## Analysis and Approach

The current personalvibe project is a sophisticated AI-assisted development tool that orchestrates YAML configurations, prompt rendering, and code generation workflows. The project has reached milestone 6.0.0 and is now focused on developer experience improvements.

The request outlines three key sprint areas:
1. Fix existing bugs and add a new smoke test
2. Create 'bugfix' task type
3. Consider and implement other developer experience needs

Given the constraint of 16,000 characters per sprint output and the need to maintain logical separation of concerns, I'll structure this milestone to address these requirements systematically.

## Milestone 7: Developer Experience Enhancement

This milestone focuses on improving the developer workflow by introducing a dedicated bugfix mode, resolving critical bugs, and enhancing the overall development experience. The work is structured to ensure each sprint delivers testable, self-contained improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Chunk 1: Bug Fixes and Infrastructure Improvements
**Estimated output: ~12,000 characters**

This chunk addresses the immediate bugs blocking development:
- Fix the sprint file naming bug (currently saves as .py instead of .md for bugfixes)
- Resolve GitHub Pages permission error in CI/CD
- Fix max_tokens parameter handling and bubble up to CLI
- Add prompt_only smoke test using sprint_template.yaml

### Chunk 2: Bugfix Mode Implementation
**Estimated output: ~14,000 characters**

This chunk introduces the new bugfix mode:
- Create src/personalvibe/data/bugfix.md prompt template
- Update ConfigModel to support 'bugfix' mode
- Implement bugfix-specific logic in run_pipeline
- Add CLI support for bugfix mode
- Ensure proper semver naming (x.y.z.md files)

### Chunk 3: Developer Experience Enhancements
**Estimated output: ~10,000 characters**

This chunk adds quality-of-life improvements:
- Add colored output for better log readability
- Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- Add validation for common configuration errors
- Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
- Add helper commands for common workflows

### Chunk 4: Testing and Documentation
**Estimated output: ~8,000 characters**

This chunk ensures robustness:
- Comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Update documentation for bugfix mode
- Add integration tests for the complete workflow
- Create example bugfix scenarios

The chunks are ordered by dependency and urgency. Chunk 1 must be completed first as it fixes blocking issues. Chunk 2 builds the core bugfix functionality. Chunk 3 enhances the overall experience, and Chunk 4 ensures everything is properly tested and documented.

Each chunk is designed to be independently testable and deliverable, following the project's established patterns for file organization, error handling, and testing conventions.
