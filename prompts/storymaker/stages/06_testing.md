Yes—what you’re seeing is the **expected** behaviour:

• The Flask app starts correctly and hot-reloads (the duplicate “LocalStorage ready …” and the `runpy` RuntimeWarning just come from Werkzeug’s “restart with stat” mechanism; they can be ignored in dev).
• We never registered a route for “/”, so hitting `http://127.0.0.1:8777/` yields a 404, likewise for `/favicon.ico`.
• All the real JSON endpoints live under `/api/*` (see `register_routes`), so a 404 on the bare root is normal.

Logical next test steps
───────────────
Below is a quick “smoke-test” checklist you can run with curl, HTTPie, Postman, or a tiny Python script. Using the special header `Authorization: DEV` bypasses JWT in local dev.

1. Ping the health check
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/health
   # → {"status":"ok"}
   ```

2. Inspect the poor-man’s spec
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/spec
   ```

3. Login flow (optional)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/login \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"email":"dev@local","password":""}'
   # Save the returned access_token if you want to test real JWTs
   ```

4. Create a character (DEV header shortcut)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/characters \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: DEV" \
        -d '{"name":"Plushie Duck","type":"toy","description":"Soft yellow plush"}'
   ```

5. List characters
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/characters -H "Authorization: DEV"
   ```

6. Create a book skeleton
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/books \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: DEV" \
        -d '{
             "name":"My First Book",
             "description":"A test book",
             "main_character":{"name":"Plushie Duck","type":"toy","description":""},
             "side_characters":[],
             "chapters":[]
        }'
   ```

7. List books / paginate
   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8777/api/books?page=1&per_page=10" -H "Authorization: DEV"
   ```

8. Run the automated test suite
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

If all of the above succeed you have verified:

• Flask routing, JSON marshaling, CORS layer
• Pydantic validation & error handling (try sending bad payloads to see 422s)
• Auth decorator in both “DEV” shortcut and real-JWT mode
• LocalStorage read/write under `data/storymaker`

───────────────
Optional polish
───────────────
• Add a simple redirect from “/” → “/api/spec” (or a tiny HTML placeholder) if 404s bother you.
• Silence the `RuntimeWarning` by running via `flask run` or setting `use_reloader=False` when you call `app.run()`.
• Hook up Swagger/OpenAPI later so the SPA can generate clients automatically.

That’s it—once the smoke tests pass, you’re ready to integrate the React front-end or continue writing deeper unit tests.
