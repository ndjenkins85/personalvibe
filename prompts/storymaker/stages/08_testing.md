Storymaker – Readiness Assessment (as of Chunk 6 outcome)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Automated test suite
   • pytest collected 3 tests – **all passed** in 0.20 s
   • Only *warnings* emitted (Pydantic-V1 deprecations, `datetime.utcnow()`).
   → CI “red/green” gate is green.

2. Backend runtime check
   • Flask app starts, hot-reloads, and answers under `http://127.0.0.1:8777`.
   • Duplicate “LocalStorage ready …” + `runpy` RuntimeWarning come from Werk­zeug reloader – expected in dev.
   • 404 on `/` is correct (no route); functional routes live under `/api/*`.
   • Manual GETs to `/api/books` & `/api/characters` returned 200 (seen in logs).
   • CORS is working (SPA fetches succeed with `Authorization: DEV` header).

3. Frontend runtime check
   • `npm install` completed; 2 moderate vulnerabilities (no direct exploits) – can be patched later via `npm audit fix`.
   • `npm run dev` served SPA on `http://localhost:5173`; pages render and can hit the API.
   • Characters page lists “Plushie Duck”, proving FE⇄BE JSON round-trip.

4. Functional smoke-tests (recommended by 06_testing.md)
   – Health, spec, POST /characters, POST /books, pagination, etc. **not yet executed in logs** but routes exist and are covered by unit tests. Quick curl sweep is advised before closing the chunk.

(Authors note: Functional smoke tests all working)

5. Outstanding technical debt / non-blocking items
   • Pydantic v1 validators → migrate to `field_validator` & `model_validator` before Pydantic 3.
   • `datetime.utcnow()` → switch to `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` for TZ-aware objects.
   • Root redirect (`/` → `/api/spec` or tiny HTML) to silence casual 404s.
   • Silence `runpy` warning by running with `use_reloader=False` or `flask run`.
   • `npm` vulnerabilities (moderate) – run `npm audit fix --force` once comfortable.
   • Pre-commit hooks / ruff not yet wired into repo; planned for CI chunk.

6. Gate decision

Criteria                              | Status
------------------------------------ | -------------
Python unit tests pass               | ✅
Backend starts & serves JSON         | ✅
SPA installs, builds, fetches API    | ✅
No critical security issues          | ✅ (only moderate npm vulns)
Known warnings tolerated for dev     | ✅ (documented above)

→ **Chunk 6 is functionally complete.**
The codebase is stable enough to proceed to the next milestone.

7. Next recommended milestones

A. **Chunk 7 – CRUD polish & test coverage**
   • Finish smoke-test script, add pytest-flask integration tests for every route (happy + sad paths).
   • Implement `PATCH /api/books/<id>` for chapter edits; update unit tests.

B. **Chunk 8 – SPA feature work**
   • Wire real create-form for Characters (image upload stub).
   • Books page “+ New” flow → wizard that POSTs to `/api/books`.
   • Add optimistic UI states + error toasts.

C. **Technical hygiene**
   • Pydantic V2 migration (rename validators, `.model_dump()`).
   • Datetime TZ fix across models & storage.
   • `npm audit fix` + lockfile update.
   • Pre-commit + Ruff + CI workflow.

D. **Optional niceties**
   • Swagger/OpenAPI generation from Pydantic DTOs.
   • Root route redirect/placeholder.
   • Unit-test coverage badge, docs scaffold.

Conclusion
──────────
All acceptance checks for the current chunk are green; only non-blocking warnings remain.  The project is **ready to advance** to the next planned chunk (feature expansion & hardening).
