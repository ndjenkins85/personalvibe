# Chiki

Chiki is a lovable plush duck and the star of a hyper-local toddler storytelling experience. The core product is a giftable bundle: a soft, characterful plush toy paired with two custom-illustrated children’s books set in the child's own neighborhood or city. For example, families in Brooklyn can read about Chiki visiting Prospect Park, getting a slice of pizza, and riding the subway — making everyday places magical.
Chiki is more than a toy or book. It’s a child’s first connection to their world. The books are written to feel familiar and comforting, while Chiki acts as a consistent character kids grow to love.

What makes Chiki special

This is Chiki, a lovable plush duck and the star of a new toddler gift bundle that combines storytelling, emotional connection, and local pride. Each set includes Chiki and two fully illustrated children’s books — but here’s the twist: the books are hyper-localized to real neighborhoods like Brooklyn, with stories set in familiar parks, pizza shops, libraries, and subways.
It’s not just a toy or a book — it’s a way for parents to say, this is where you live, this is your world. And as families travel or move, they can collect books from new cities. It’s like Paddington meets Airbnb for toddlers.

How to draw Chiki - Style guide

Base Character Design:
- Species & Type: Chiki is a plush yellow duck, sized like a toddler’s toy (small enough to sit in a stroller). He is soft, rounded, and made of plush material.
- Body Shape: Round and squat, with short stubby wings and small legs. Chiki should look slightly plump, emphasizing cuddliness and innocence.
- Fur Texture: Light, warm lemon-yellow plush fur with a soft, matte surface — never shiny or plastic-looking. Avoid exaggerated fluff or cartoon-like fuzz.
- Size Proportion: Head and body should be roughly the same size, in line with plush toy aesthetics. The head sits above the torso like a compact ball, not elongated.

Facial Features:
- Eyes: Small, solid black eyes, spaced slightly wider than usual for cuteness. Eyes should appear as plastic safety eyes or stitched black dots. They must NOT be shiny, glassy, expressive, or humanoid. No irises or eye whites.
- Beak: Small, rounded, matte orange beak, sitting low on the face. It should not be flat or sharply defined. The shape is more like a soft wedge, projecting slightly outward.
- Cheeks: Very important. Chiki has light pink blush on both cheeks, in perfect circular spots. These must be clearly visible and symmetrical, mimicking the style of felt or airbrushed plush detailing. No complex gradients or cheek animation.

Signature Accessories:
- Red Scarf:
    - Fabric: Knit or fleece texture, NOT shiny or patterned
    - Style: Wrapped once around the neck, with two short tails hanging forward (not flying or floating)
    - Color: Bold red, not maroon or pink. Consistent across all versions.
- Red Booties:
    - Appearance: Patent, slightly shiny and a little worn red booties, covering both feet completely
    - Shape: Slightly oversized, rounded toe, stitched to imply soft soles. No laces or detail.
    - Color: Matching red tone to the scarf. Avoid variation.
- Brown Messenger Bag:
    - Strap: Slung across Chiki’s left shoulder, resting at right hip
    - Material: Felt or soft canvas. Brown or tan fabric — matte only
    - Shape: Rounded rectangular flap with soft corners
    - Labeling:
    - Front flap must display the word “CHIKI”
    - White lettering, drawn in toddler-style handwriting, as if made using a white-out pen
    - Lettering should be imperfect: uneven size, crooked angles, possibly shaky lines
    - Position: Slightly off-centered and visibly hand-drawn, not digital text or clean font
    - Do NOT interpret this label as clean branding — its charm is in being childlike and handmade

Other Visual Standards:
- No Hat: Chiki does not wear any kind of hat or headgear.
- No Clothing Beyond Described: Do not add shirts, overalls, patterns, or costumes unless explicitly instructed in themed variants.
- Expression: Neutral to friendly. No extreme emotions. Chiki should never appear cartoonishly animated or exaggerated in posture unless specifically requested by the scene
- Texture Balance: Every visible element should follow plush realism. No glossy digital-style fabrics, plastic surfaces, or hard edges.

What to Avoid:
- Exaggerated cartoon styling (e.g. anime eyes, emoji expressions)
- Misplaced or perfectly clean “CHIKI” bag lettering
- Color mismatches (e.g. scarf not matching boots)
- Hats, jackets, or other accessories not included in IP
- Changing body proportions or giving Chiki human features
